# Question 10 ==============================================

"""
(a) Generate a simulated data set with 20 observations in each of
three classes (i.e. 60 observations total), and 50 variables.
Hint: There are a number of functions in R that you can use to
generate data. One example is the rnorm() function; runif() is
another option. Be sure to add a mean shift to the observations
in each class so that there are three distinct classes.

the observations in each of the three classes. If the three classes
appear separated in this plot, then continue on to part (c). If
not, then return to part (a) and modify the simulation so that
there is greater separation between the three classes. Do not
continue to part (c) until the three classes show at least some
separation in the first two principal component score vectors.

(c) Perform K-means clustering of the observations with K = 3.
How well do the clusters that you obtained in K-means cluster-
ing compare to the true class labels?

Hint: You can use the table() function in R to compare the true
class labels to the class labels obtained by clustering. Be careful
how you interpret the results: K-means clustering will arbitrarily
number the clusters, so you cannot simply check whether the true
class labels and clustering labels are the same.
